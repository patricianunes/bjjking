# BJJKing - Game


Overview
---


Welcome to BJJKing

This is an app for BJJ fanatics.

The objective of the project was to use all the technologies and knowledge that I have learned.

I wrote the project with **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby and Rails**. 

I wrote the tables for Athletes, Team and Belt then started to do the associations, next was the controllers with views for create a CRUD Athletes and Team, for belts I just need read. I need to start to think how could I do the users and I did what we did in class. When I have all working well at each page I start with Bootstrap.

After doing the basics I try to improve my code and make looks better, I focused on Bootstrap and try to make look pretty, but really need a lot to make look great!

I really wanted to make my project the most simply possible, easy to read and understandable.

Still need some good thinks like, search and filter for that searchs, titles, next fights, but everything could be better and better.

## What I have Learned

By the time I submit this project, I covered new ground in many of the big themes of the course:

**Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.

**Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.

**Programming Fundamentals**: Work with server, data base, rubi and rails, use Gems to help to do what we need.

**Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style. Also learn how to do associations with diferent tables in the data base, make a "CRUD" for each one.

**Browser Applications**: Dive into Bootstrap use the librarie to get lots of style for free.

**Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment using Heroku.

**Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

### My big Goals

- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- Use my programming skills to build a app
- Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
- Build a dynamic app that allows people to use in real life

<!-- ###Necessary Deliverables

A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
